/*
* Model View Controller or MVC is an Architectural Design pattern this is used to write an organised code for Android applications. Code following the MVC pattern is divided into three parts:
*
* - Model: It is the place where you write all your Business logic and data state. So, all the data classes of your application are considered as Model.
* - View: It is the user interface that a user sees. In Android, the user interface is built with the help of XML.
*   So, all the views that the user sees come under this category.
* - Controller: A controller is simply a communication medium between the Model and the View. It takes the user input from the view.
*   It processes the request and it sends the data from the Model to the view.
