# Android-Design-Patterns
This small project shows android patterns in separate packages.

## Patterns categories:

### Creational Pattern
The Creational Pattern is used to create some object without showing the logic or the steps that are involved in creating the object. So, every time you want an object, you need not instantiate the object by using the new operator. So, this makes the creation of object easier and can be easily created again and again. Some of the examples of Creational Pattern are Builder, Singleton, and Dependency Injection.

1. Builder
2. Dependency Injection
3. Singleton


### Structural Pattern
In this Design Pattern, we are concerned about the structure of the code. Here we follow some particular structural pattern that will help in understanding the code and the working of code just by looking at the structure of the code. Some of the common Structural Pattern used are Adapter, Bridge, Facade, Proxy, etc.

1. Adapter
2. Facade
3. Factory

### Behavioural Pattern
1. Observer
